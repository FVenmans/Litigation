# Litigation
This is the code associated with the paper "The Effect of litigation on firm value" published in Nature Sustainability. 
The excell file has the filing and decision dates, including who we categorized them and firm identifier codes. 
The .do files have the stata code, the first file builds up the database (and requires company returns, which are proprietary data which we cannot provide). The file factors.dta contains the risk-free rate, market return, smb and hml factors for both the US and EU and is open source from Ken French's website. 
The second .do file does the statistical analysis, and builds the tables of the paper.
